## The Goal

In this lesson, you'll learn how to apply professional finishing touches to your data visualizations. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to enhance the readability and visual appeal of your charts through strategic use of themes, text formatting, and layout adjustments. You'll practice customizing titles, subtitles, axes, and other chart elements to create polished, publication-ready graphics. These skills will enable you to present your data journalism projects with a level of professionalism that meets industry standards.

## Why Visualize Data?

More to come.

## The Basics

For the last two tutorials, we've been circling around the last bits you need to make a graphic into something publishable. With annotations, we learned about the need for additional text like headlines and chatter, as well as fixing the axis labels so a normal person can read it. We learned that every graphic needs the following to be reasonably complete:

* Headline
* Chatter
* The main body
* Annotations
* Labels
* Source line
* Credit line

Here's a graphic from the New York Times, annotated: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/chartannotated.png"))
```

After text came color. We want to use color sparingly to draw attention. We want to use contrast to give people a giant arrow pointing at what we want them to see. 

The last step -- the finishing touches, if you will -- for a graphic boil down to two things: The first is ditching what ggplot does by default. The second is using typography to create a text hierarchy that separates our text and sets a level of importance in people's minds.

Let's explore fixing up ggplot's output. We'll need a graphic to work with first, so I'm going to use the scatterplot we made in the annotations chapter. 

```{r finishing-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
national <- read_csv("https://the-art-of-data-journalism.github.io/tutorial-data/college-cost/national.csv")

exclusivencheap <- national |> 
  filter(ADM_RATE < .2) |> 
  filter(COSTT4_A < 50000)

natstats <- national |> 
  summarize(
    average_admit_rate = round(mean(ADM_RATE)*100, 0),
    average_cost = round(mean(COSTT4_A),0)
  )
```

```{r finishing1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=national, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),

    ) +

The first thing you should do with any chart that isn't a waffle chart -- more on that later -- is remove the default plot look and grey background by adding a pre-defined theme. There are two you should use to clean your charts up: `theme_minimal` or `theme_light`. These pre-packaged themes do just that. They make your chart cleaner and easier to read in one swoop. 

**NOTE**: Adding a `theme()` is something you do last. And if you're going to change theme elements, you need to **apply your prepackaged theme first**, then do your theme customization. Everything in ggplot is rendered in order. If you do custom theming, THEN apply the prepackaged theme, the prepackaged theme will overwrite anything you did. So `theme_minimal()` or `theme_light()` comes first.

### Exercise 1: Dump the grey background.

Scroll down here and add `theme_minimal()` at the very end. We're just adding it on, like any other part of ggplot.

```{r finishing2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=national, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="grey"
    ) + 
  geom_point(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="red"
    ) + 
  geom_text_repel(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A, label=INSTNM),
    size=3
    ) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.7246474) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40745.59) +
  geom_text(aes(x=.87, y=85000, label="High admits, high cost"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=.3, y=15000, label="Fewer admits, below average cost"), color="blue") + 
  labs(
    x="Admit rate", 
    y="Average annual cost", 
    title="Exclusive doesn't mean expensive", 
    subtitle="According to the federal Department of Education, there are seven schools who admit fewer than \n20 percent of applicants but are among the most affordable.", 
    caption="Source: US Department of Education | By Your Name"
    ) +
  ____()
```
```{r finishing2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=national, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="grey"
    ) + 
  geom_point(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="red"
    ) + 
  geom_text_repel(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A, label=INSTNM),
    size=3
    ) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.7246474) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40745.59) +
  geom_text(aes(x=.87, y=85000, label="High admits, high cost"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=.3, y=15000, label="Fewer admits, below average cost"), color="blue") + 
  labs(
    x="Admit rate", 
    y="Average annual cost", 
    title="Exclusive doesn't mean expensive", 
    subtitle="According to the federal Department of Education, there are seven schools who admit fewer than \n20 percent of applicants but are among the most affordable.", 
    caption="Source: US Department of Education | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r finishing2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Compare that to your previous chart. Easier to read, right?

We're off to a good start, but our text has no real hierarchy. We want our headline to stand out more. So let's change that. When it comes to changing text, the place to do that is in the theme element. [There are a lot of ways to modify the theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html). An overwhelming number of ways to modify a theme. The dirty secret is we only need a few. The rest you look up when the need arises.

### Exercise 2: Bigger and bolder.

We'll start easy. Let's make the headline bigger -- size 20 -- and bold. Scroll down here under theme_minimal and you'll see where this happens.

```{r finishing3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=national, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="grey"
    ) + 
  geom_point(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="red"
    ) + 
  geom_text_repel(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A, label=INSTNM),
    size=3
    ) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.7246474) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40745.59) +
  geom_text(aes(x=.87, y=85000, label="High admits, high cost"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=.3, y=15000, label="Fewer admits, below average cost"), color="blue") + 
  labs(
    x="Admit rate", 
    y="Average annual cost", 
    title="Exclusive doesn't mean expensive", 
    subtitle="According to the federal Department of Education, there are seven schools who admit fewer than \n20 percent of applicants but are among the most affordable.", 
    caption="Source: US Department of Education | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = ____, face = "____")
    ) 
```
```{r finishing3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=national, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="grey"
    ) + 
  geom_point(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="red"
    ) + 
  geom_text_repel(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A, label=INSTNM),
    size=3
    ) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.7246474) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40745.59) +
  geom_text(aes(x=.87, y=85000, label="High admits, high cost"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=.3, y=15000, label="Fewer admits, below average cost"), color="blue") + 
  labs(
    x="Admit rate", 
    y="Average annual cost", 
    title="Exclusive doesn't mean expensive", 
    subtitle="According to the federal Department of Education, there are seven schools who admit fewer than \n20 percent of applicants but are among the most affordable.", 
    caption="Source: US Department of Education | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold")
    ) 
```
```{r finishing3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Now let's fix a few other things -- like the axis labels being too big, the subtitle could be smaller and lets drop some grid lines. Let's make the subtitle 10, the axis labels 8. Scroll down and take a look.

### Exercise 3: More text heirarchy.

```{r finishing4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=national, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="grey"
    ) + 
  geom_point(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="red"
    ) + 
  geom_text_repel(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A, label=INSTNM),
    size=3
    ) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.7246474) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40745.59) +
  geom_text(aes(x=.87, y=85000, label="High admits, high cost"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=.3, y=15000, label="Fewer admits, below average cost"), color="blue") + 
  labs(
    x="Admit rate", 
    y="Average annual cost", 
    title="Exclusive doesn't mean expensive", 
    subtitle="According to the federal Department of Education, there are seven schools who admit fewer than \n20 percent of applicants but are among the most affordable.", 
    caption="Source: US Department of Education | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = ____, face = "____"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = ____), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=____), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    ) 
```
```{r finishing4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=national, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="grey"
    ) + 
  geom_point(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="red"
    ) + 
  geom_text_repel(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A, label=INSTNM),
    size=3
    ) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.7246474) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40745.59) +
  geom_text(aes(x=.87, y=85000, label="High admits, high cost"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=.3, y=15000, label="Fewer admits, below average cost"), color="blue") + 
  labs(
    x="Admit rate", 
    y="Average annual cost", 
    title="Exclusive doesn't mean expensive", 
    subtitle="According to the federal Department of Education, there are seven schools who admit fewer than \n20 percent of applicants but are among the most affordable.", 
    caption="Source: US Department of Education | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    ) 
```
```{r finishing4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

One last thing: ggplot, by default, sets the margin for the title and subtitle to the edge of the chart area -- the area were the data appears. It creates an odd spacing where the title is shifted right for little reason. We can fix that too in `theme()` by making the plot.title.position set to the plot. 

### Exercise 4: Fixing the indent

```{r finishing5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "finishing-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=national, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="grey"
    ) + 
  geom_point(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="red"
    ) + 
  geom_text_repel(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A, label=INSTNM),
    size=3
    ) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.7246474) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40745.59) +
  geom_text(aes(x=.87, y=85000, label="High admits, high cost"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=.3, y=15000, label="Fewer admits, below average cost"), color="blue") + 
  labs(
    x="Admit rate", 
    y="Average annual cost", 
    title="Exclusive doesn't mean expensive", 
    subtitle="According to the federal Department of Education, there are seven schools who admit fewer than \n20 percent of applicants but are among the most affordable.", 
    caption="Source: US Department of Education | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = ____, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = ____), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=____), 
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    plot.title.position = "____"
    ) 
```
```{r finishing5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=national, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="grey"
    ) + 
  geom_point(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A),
    color="red"
    ) + 
  geom_text_repel(
    data=exclusivencheap, 
    aes(x=ADM_RATE, y=COSTT4_A, label=INSTNM),
    size=3
    ) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.7246474) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40745.59) +
  geom_text(aes(x=.87, y=85000, label="High admits, high cost"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=.3, y=15000, label="Fewer admits, below average cost"), color="blue") + 
  labs(

    y="Average annual cost", 
    title="Exclusive doesn't mean expensive", 
    subtitle="According to the federal Department of Education, there are seven schools who admit fewer than \n20 percent of applicants but are among the most affordable.",

## Waffle charts require special attention

Frequently in my classes, students use the waffle charts library quite extensively to make graphics. This is a quick walkthrough on how to get a waffle chart into a publication ready state. 

Let's make a quick waffle chart using my most favorite silly dataset: Climate prognostications from groundhogs, other assorted animals, taxidermied animals and other objects from around the US. You thought Punxatawney Phil was the only one? Oh no. There were 73 others in 2024 who made a prediction on early spring vs longer winter. So what was the consensus? Let's visualize. 

```{r waffle-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
predictions <- c("Early Spring"=55, "Longer Winter"=19)
```

We can add labels and themes, but you have to be careful. The waffle library is applying it's own theme -- like theme_minimal -- but if we override something they are using in their theme, some things that are hidden come back and make it worse. So here is an example of how to use ggplot's `labs` and the `theme` to make a fully publication ready graphic. They just get added with a + after the waffle.

```{r waffle1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "waffle-load-data", message=FALSE}
waffle(
        predictions, 
        rows = 5, 
        colors = c("yellow", "lightblue")
) +
  labs(
    x = "1 square = 1 prediction",
    title="Early spring it is", 
    subtitle="The groundhogs, lobsters and other assorted predictors from around the \nUS and Canada were decisvely feeling spring this year.",
    caption="Source: Groundhog-Day.com | Graphic by Matt Waite") + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )
```
```{r waffle1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
waffle(
        predictions, 
        rows = 5, 
        colors = c("yellow", "lightblue")
) +
  labs(
    x = "1 square = 1 prediction",
    title="Early spring it is", 
    subtitle="The groundhogs, lobsters and other assorted predictors from around the \nUS and Canada were decisvely feeling spring this year.",
    caption="Source: Groundhog-Day.com | Graphic by Matt Waite") + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )
```
```{r waffle1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

But what if we're using a waffle iron? It gets tougher. 

Here is a full example. I start with my waffle iron code, but note that each waffle is pretty much a self contained thing. That's because a waffle iron isn't really a thing. It's just a way to group waffles together, so you have to make each waffle individually. My first waffle has the title and subtitle and the x-axis label is the year. The bottom one has no title or subtitle but it does have the caption and the axis label has a little trick to add a return into the label, so I get both the team and the unit in there. 

```{r waffle2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "waffle-load-data", message=FALSE}
prediction24 <- c("Early Spring"=55, "Longer Winter"=19, 1)
prediction23 <- c("Early Spring"=40, "Longer Winter"=35)


iron(
  waffle(
  prediction24,
  rows=5,
  colors = c("yellow", "lightblue", "white")) + 
   labs(
     x="2024",
     title="Early spring it is",
     subtitle="The groundhogs, lobsters and other assorted predictors from around the \nUS and Canada were decisvely feeling spring this year.") + 
   theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ),
  waffle(
    prediction23,
    rows=5,
    colors = c("yellow", "lightblue")) + 
    labs(
     x = "2023\n1 square = 1 prediction",
     caption="Source: Groundhog-Day.com | Graphic by Matt Waite"
     )
) 
```
```{r waffle2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
prediction24 <- c("Early Spring"=55, "Longer Winter"=19, 1)
prediction23 <- c("Early Spring"=40, "Longer Winter"=35)


iron(
  waffle(
  prediction24,
  rows=5,
  colors = c("yellow", "lightblue", "white")) + 
   labs(
     x="2024",
     title="Early spring it is",
     subtitle="The groundhogs, lobsters and other assorted predictors from around the \nUS and Canada were decisvely feeling spring this year.") + 
   theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ),
  waffle(
    prediction23,
    rows=5,
    colors = c("yellow", "lightblue")) + 
    labs(
     x = "2023\n1 square = 1 prediction",
     caption="Source: Groundhog-Day.com | Graphic by Matt Waite"
     )
) 
```
```{r waffle2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Note: These finishing touches aren't optional. They're required of every graphic you create going forward. They are what makes professional graphics look professional. It's the careful consideration of every element on the screen and how they impact a reader's understanding of the graphic.

## The Recap

Throughout this lesson, you've mastered the art of refining your data visualizations for professional presentation. You've learned to apply clean themes, adjust text hierarchy, customize chart elements, and fine-tune layouts for both standard ggplot charts and waffle charts. Remember, these finishing touches are not just cosmetic - they're essential for effectively communicating your data story to your audience. Always consider how these final adjustments can enhance the clarity and impact of your visualizations.

## Terms to Know

- Theme: A predefined set of visual parameters in ggplot2 that control the overall appearance of a chart.
